Path Cleaner
---------------------
Tonight I noticed that I had a huge `PATH` environment variable on my machine. 
I saw many useless, orphaned entries. I looked around  for a tool to clean those 
up but to no avail. So I decided to write one while I was waiting for GTA 5 
download to complete. So here it is. It can detect and correct the following 
problems:

 - Empty/missing folders
 - Folders without any executables
 - Duplicate entries
